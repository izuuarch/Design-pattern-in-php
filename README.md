## the code format 
## for solid desin principle
## for single principle in solid design pattern
i assumed that i was working in a php application so i created a  folder inside the app folder and called it solid.
inside it i created a file and called it (solidresponsibility.php)

i demonstrated the format a single principle should be in a solid design pattern . Take a look at the class, you will notice that theres a class for handling the db data and a separate class was declared for handling file exportation which i created as a file in the solid folder.
